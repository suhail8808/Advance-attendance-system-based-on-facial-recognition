# Advance-attendance-system-based-on-facial-recognition
Overview
This Advanced Attendance System leverages facial recognition technology to automate the attendance management process, offering a more secure, efficient, and contactless alternative to traditional methods. The system is built using Django as the backend framework and integrates powerful computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces in real time.

It simplifies attendance tracking for schools, universities, and workplaces by eliminating the need for manual record-keeping and preventing proxy attendance.

Features
Facial Detection: Uses the Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in images or live video streams.
Facial Recognition: Implements the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) algorithm for accurate facial recognition.
Real-time Attendance: Captures and marks attendance in real time, ensuring a seamless and instant process.
User Management: Provides options for adding, deleting, or updating student or employee profiles.
Database Integration: Stores attendance records, user profiles, and other details in a MySQL database, managed through XAMPP.
Admin Dashboard: An intuitive admin interface for managing user data and viewing attendance reports.
Scalability: Designed to scale for organizations of various sizes, with the capability to handle a large number of users.
High Accuracy: Ensures high accuracy in recognizing individuals, even in varying lighting conditions or slight changes in appearance.
Technologies Used
Backend: Python
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the user interface)
Database: MySQL (managed through XAMPP)
Facial Detection: Haar Cascade Classifier (OpenCV)
Facial Recognition: Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH)
IDE: Jupyter (for initial model training and testing)
